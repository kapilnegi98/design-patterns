there are multiple ways to break this singleton e.g.
Reflections
Serialize and Deserialiser

Enum is the best / unbreakable way to create singleton.


In Java, the initialization of enum constants is lazy. Enum constants are only initialized
when they are accessed for the first time, and this initialization is thread-safe.

Reflection:
Constructor Access:
Without using an enum, a singleton class typically has a private constructor to prevent external
instantiation. However, using reflection, it is possible to set the accessibility of the constructor to
 true and create a new instance of the class.

Using an enum for the singleton prevents this type of reflection attack because enum constructors are implicitly
private and cannot be made accessible.

Field Modification:
Reflection allows access to private fields and methods. Without using an enum, if the singleton instance is
stored in a field, it is possible to modify that field using reflection.

Enum instances cannot be modified or created externally, which adds a level of security against this type of
 reflection-based attack.

 Serialization:
 When an enum is used to implement a singleton, Java ensures that enum constants are only instantiated once during
 the classloading process. This inherent property of enums makes them suitable for singletons and addresses some of the challenges associated with serialization:

 Guaranteed Single Instance: Enum instances are guaranteed to be singletons, and there is no way to create
 additional instances through reflection or any other means. This ensures that the singleton pattern is maintained
  during serialization and deserialization.

 Preservation of Singleton State: During the serialization process, the enum instance's state is captured
  in the byte stream. When the byte stream is deserialized, the enum constants are recreated, and the singleton state is preserved.


In class based singleton:
Sometimes in distributed systems, we need to implement Serializable interface in the singleton class so
 that we can store its state in the file system and retrieve it at a later point in time.
The problem with serialized singleton class is that whenever we deserialize it,
it will create a new instance of the class.
This can be resolved by  Implementing readResolve method:

when serializing an enum, field variables are not getting serialized.
For example, if we serialize and deserialize the SingletonEnum class, we will lose the value of the int value field .
