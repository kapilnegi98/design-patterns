Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without
specifying their concrete classes.
Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern except the fact that its more like
 factory of factories.


pros:
You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
 Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place,
 making the code easier to support.
 Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.


cons:
 The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are
 introduced along with the pattern.
