Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify
multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.

pros:
 Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publisher’s
 code (and vice versa if there’s a publisher interface).
 You can establish relations between objects at runtime.

cons:
 Subscribers are notified in random order.
